[.stix-doc-information-heading]*Abstract:*

The current STIX 2.1 Incident object exists as a stub in the hopes that future work would allow STIX Incidents to be more fully fleshed out using extensions, and that in time a set of core features could be defined to be migrated into a future version of the Incident object or the community could arrive at the consensus to continue to use these extensions.

In the 1.0 version of the core incident extension information on impact, events, and tasks were embedded within the Incident itself, however this was found to have limitations.
In the 2.0 version of the core incident extension information on impact, events, and tasks were separated into independent SDO's, however this approach did not meet TC requirements and did not collect provenance of observations to enable judgement on evidence.

As such a 3.0 version of this extension has been created in order to improve the sequencing model, to more closely approximate CACO, and to introduce a better method collecting provenance of observations to enable better decision processes, and more complex incidents to be accurately modeled.

These extensions allow tracking [stixtype]#{incident_url}[incidents]# across their life cycle, and enable better evidentiary judgment processes where each type of  [stixtype]#{sighting_url}[sighting]#, has [stixtype]#<<evidence,evidence>># extensions to capture the provenance, and enable evidentiary value to be assessed. This enables semi-automated judgements and forensic evaluation of decision veracity.

Many sighting types create [stixtype]#<<event,events>>#, which  are flagged for investigation resulting in [stixtype]#{incident_url}[incidents]# with [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># being worked to resolve these. [stixtype]#<<event, Events>># and [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>>#, can be organised into serial and parallel workflows using  [stixtype]#<<sequence,sequence>># objects, or they can be considered as atomic and discrete if [stixtype]#<<sequence,sequences>># are not present.

Incidents have [stixtype]#<<impact,impacts>># that change over time.
[stixtype]#<<event,Events>># can cause or influence these [stixtype]#<<impact,impacts>># which are in turn mitigated and potentially resolved by [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># performed as part of the incident response process.
Both [stixtype]#<<event,events>># and [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># can exist independent of [stixtype]#{incident_url}[incidents]# and in some workflows may occur prior to an incident being declared as malicious.


== 1. Incidents in STIX

Incident objects represent cases composed of [stixtype]#<<event,events>># and [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># as well as actual or potential [stixtype]#<<impact,impacts>>#. [stixtype]#<<event,Events>># and [stixtype]#<<task,tasks>># can be sequenced by [stixtype]#<<sequence,sequence>># objects, which
An Incident SDO can be created prior to a formal determination that the incident has an impact as a way to logically track case work in an attempt to investigate events or lower level alerts.

The Incident object should have sufficient properties to represent the current state of the incident or investigation while serving as an anchor point to record both related activities and the impact to an organization.

== 2. Extensions

=== 2.1. Incident Core

The properties and additional types within the Incident Core Extension are defined below. As this is not a top-level object, fields such as identifier are not present.  This extension *MUST* use [stixliteral]#extension-definition--ef765651-680c-498d-9894-99799f2fa126# as its extension ID.

==== 2.3.2. Extensions

The Impact SDO is currently an extension, but as there are many specific types of impacts with their own unique properties it emulates the File SCO through the use of STIX Extensions to provide the granular details of specific categories of impacts.
As such every Impact *MUST* have an extension that has the same value of the *impact_category*.
This allows consumers to quickly validate their ability to process this category of impact and then load all of its specific details.

Producers *SHOULD* use both the Extension Definition and one of these extensions.

=== 2.6. Sighting Extensions for Evidence
The [stixtype]#{sighting_url}[Sighting]# object is used for connecting [stixtype]#{observation_url}[Observed Data]# objects to SDO's, such as Indicators, Malware and Threat Actors.

Observations and Sightings have different evidentiary weightings based on their type (what they are) and provenance (how they were derived).
Weightings cannot be established as provenance data is not collected for each observation, and confidence cannot be established.
At present, Observations and Sightings cannot be added together as evidence, as they are different in nature.


==== 2.6.1 Evidence Extensions

There are at least 8 distinguishable sources of Sightings, each with their own data format for recording their provenance. These are defined as extensions, as listed below.

Producers *SHOULD* use the definition extension and one of the 8 evidence extensions, to attach provenance to a [stixtype]#{sighting_url}[Sighting]# object.

===== 2.6.1.2. Alert Evidence Extension
An Alert can be issued by a system or a user. Generally, when an Alert is issued, it is not known whether it is actually nefarious.
As an example:

- A suspicious email is reported by a user, and the associated SCO’s and SRO’s are collected in an Observed-Data object
- A Sighting is established where the Indicator has a type of “unknown”, and connected to an Event

Alerts are often used to initiailise an incident. Conceivably, once an Alert is qualified as a true positive, it could be joined to another Alert from another Incident. The Python class name is [stixliteral]#SightingAlert#.

- A Sighting is established where the SDO is of type Identity, and then connected to an Event

Anecdotes are used to initiailise an incident. Conceivably, an Anecdote may also be issued that defines an Impact, rather than an Event
Anecdotes are expected to have low confidence and result in the need to do tasks to increase the confidence. The Python class name is [stixliteral]#SightingAnecdote#.

- SCO: For example a list of other user accounts that received the same email, queried from Exchange server, and is an Event. This example is shown to the right

Non-SCO Context data is not an observation, nor a sighting, but it is Evidence. Different Context sources (e.g. SAP, SalesForce etc.) will probably have different provenance formats.  The Python class name is [stixliteral]#SightingContext#.

===== 2.6.1.5. Exclusion List Evidence Extension
An Exclusion List is a source that provides a list of entities that have been shown by their processes (?) to be nefarious. Generally Exclusion lists are focused on specific approaches, such as phshing etc.

There are often multiple sources covering the same approach, and it is to be expected that if an entity is found in multiple sources, then it has more confidence than if it is found in one out of many sources.

A search on an Exclusion List can result in a sighting, but not an event, as it adds to the data available about.  The Python class name is [stixliteral]#SightingExclusion#.

A Hunt is a targeted search using a hunting platform, such as Kestrel, or similar, started as a Task.
A Hunt can result in:

2. Scope of Impact, which machines were impacted -> Impact
3. An Alert, since an unknown threat has been discovered -> SCO

A Hunt will result in an Event when an SCO is found, but can also result only in an Impact.  The Python class name is [stixliteral]#SightingHunt#.

===== 2.6.1.8. Framework Evidence Extension
Since SCO’s are ephemeral, the desire is to move up the Pyramid of Pain to more abstract characterisations, which are harder for attackers to evade.
Frameworks, such as Mitre ATT&CK and DISARM are commonly used. As an example:

- A suspicious email is found, and associated SCO’s and SRO’s are collected in Observed-Data object
- Once phishing is confirmed, a Sighting is established with ATT&CK Technique T1566

Assignment of a Framework Component requires a judgement, or a correlation from a knowledge base, and thereby has subjectivity.  The Python class name is [stixliteral]#SightingFramework#.

===== 2.6.1.9. External Evidence Extension
Threat Reports are posted by researchers on free and paid services, such as MISP. This is one method of confirming that an unknown Indicator is actually malicious. As an example:

- A suspicious email is found, and the associated SCO’s and SRO’s are collected in an Observed-Data object
- A Sighting is established where the Indicator has a type of “malicious-activity”, and connected to an Event

However, reliability of a threat report is a concern, and confidence needs to be established for each individual provider in a channel such as MISP.  The Python class name is [stixliteral]#SightingExternal#.
